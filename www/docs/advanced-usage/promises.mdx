title: Using with Promises
---

When dealing with data fetching and promises its more convenient to tell the user what is going on!
With **rc-toastr,** you can use the `toast.loading` method to achieve that!

This method accept the `Promise` as first argument and the second is an object where you specify what to do in each of the states `laoding`, `success`, or `error` . these states can be either a string and we will toast it to the user automatically OR for the `success` and `error` can have also the value of `function` that has either that data received or the occurred as a parameter, here is a practical example

```jsx
toast.loading(
    new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(() => resolve({name: 'John Doe'}), 2000)),
    {
        loading: 'loading...',
        success: (data) => toast.success(`Welcome back ${data.name}!`)
        error: (err)=> toast.error(err.message)
    }
)
```

import Toaster from '../../src/components/Toaster/with-promise.tsx'

<Toaster />

This example uses `success` and `error` as `functions` but you can use simple string that will be toasted to the user,
